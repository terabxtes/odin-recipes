    <p>Tomato bisque is creamier than standard tomato soup, and our version has flavor secrets that make it anything but average â€” with plenty of five-star reviews to prove it. Our easy recipe starts by cooking just a little bacon in your soup pot, then layering in onion, carrot, celery and garlic for a flavorful base. Our test kitchen recommends canned tomatoes for the perfect balance of convenience and deep tomato-y flavor, making this a year-round favorite. Add cream for silky richness and you have a perfectly comforting, elegant bowl of soup.</p>
    
    <p>Total Time: <strong>1 HR</strong> (45 mins Active & 15 mins Prep)</p>
    <p>Yields: <strong>4 to 6 Servings</strong></p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>4</strong> tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> tablespoon minced bacon <em>(about 1/2 ounce)</em></li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> Spanish onion, chopped</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> carrot, chopped</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> stalk celery, chopped</li>
        <li><strong>4</strong> cloves garlic, minced/li>
        <li><strong>5 </strong>tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li><strong>5 cups</strong> chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned</li>
        <li><strong>1 (28-ounce) can</strong> whole, peeled tomatoes (with liquid), roughly chopped</li>
        <li><strong>3</strong> parsley sprigs</li>
        <li><strong>3</strong> fresh thyme sprigs</li>
        <li><strong>1 cup</strong> heavy cream</li>
        <li><strong>1 3/4 teaspoon</strong> kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring, until crisp and most of the fat has rendered, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside. Lower the heat to medium, add the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until soft and fragrant, about 8 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Pour in the broth and tomatoes and bring to a boil while whisking constantly. Tie the parsley sprigs, thyme, and bay leaf together with a piece of kitchen twine and add to the pot. Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.</li>
        <li>When the soup base is cool, remove and discard the herb bundle. Working in batches, transfer the mixture to a blender and puree until smooth. Using a sieve over a large bowl, strain the tomato puree. Return the puree to the pot and reheat over medium heat. </li>
        <li>Whisk the heavy cream and salt into the soup and season with pepper to taste. Divide among warm soup bowls, garnish with the crispy bacon, and serve immediately. </li>
        
    </ol>
