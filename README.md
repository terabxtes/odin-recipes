# odin-recipes
Welcome to my very first coding project! This mini website was built as part of The Odin Project Foundations curriculum. The goal was to get comfortable using basic HTML by creating a simple recipe site.
Whatâ€™s Inside

The site includes three delicious recipes:

    Chicken Parmesan 

    Tomato Bisque 

    CrÃ¨me BrÃ»lÃ©e 

Each recipe is linked from the homepage and features ingredients and steps to follow.
What I Learned

    Writing and structuring HTML pages

    Creating internal links between multiple HTML files

    Organizing a basic folder/file structure for a website

Challenges & Progress

I ran into a few bumps learning how to commit and push changes to GitHub (still getting used to the commands ðŸ˜…), but Iâ€™m starting to get the hang of it. This project was a great intro to both HTML and version control.

Thanks for checking it out!
